          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Conducted an analysis of survey responses collected from other University of Maryland students to examine the relationship between various demographic factors and perceived "jerkiness" of strangers from Reddit's "r/AITA", a subreddit where users post stories and ask if they are the "a**hole" in a situation. Utilized statistical tests and visualizations in Python to explore the data and identify correlations.
          </p>
          <h3>Details</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Performed extensive <b>data cleaning</b> including handling missing values, renaming columns, and merging datasets to prepare for analysis.</li>
              <li>Created informative <b>visualizations</b> using seaborn and matplotlib to illustrate the distribution and relationships within the data.</li>
              <li>Conducted a comprehensive <b>analysis</b> of survey data to identify trends and correlations between demographic factors and perceived "jerkiness".</li>
              <li>Applied chi-square tests to determine the <b>statistical significance</b> of the relationships between categorical variables.</li>
              <li>Discovered that students from a separate section of the course were not primed when providing their responses before continuing with the analysis.</li>
              <li>Concluded that we must fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between the responses to the scenarious about children between surveyees of different genders.</li>
              <li>Documented the entire project process, including data issues, cleaning steps, hypothesis formulation, statistical tests, and findings, in a well-organized, detailed, and concise manner to ensure clarity and understanding.</li>
